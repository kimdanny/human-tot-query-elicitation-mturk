# Image Deselection Criteria

Collected images were removed from the visual stimuli collection if at least one criterion is satisfied.

## Movie
1. Inappropriate picture (adult content, bloody, gore, scary, phobic, etc.)
2. Movie title shown in the image.
3. Release date is after November 2023 (too recent).


## Landmark
1. Unlikely to be recognized by people in the United States.
2. Entity name shown in the image (e.g., park name).
3. Can draw good query terms from the image (e.g., street address in a picture).
4. Ambiguous: ambiguous to discern which object we are asking about (e.g., a picture of Trafalgar Square has Nelson's Column and the National Gallery in the picture).
5. Image is likely to mislead participants into thinking about a different entity (e.g., Pula Arena in Croatia looks very similar to the Colosseum in Italy).
6. Not a physical landmark picture (e.g., painting of a landmark, landmark location on a map, logo of a landmark).
7. Inappropriate places (e.g., brothel).
8. Image quality is too low.


## Person
1. Multiple people present in one image (e.g., all members of a band).
2. Face covered by a large portion of another object (e.g., microphone, sunglasses, mask, etc.).
3. Image quality is too low.
4. Person's name appears as text in the image.
5. Not a person's picture (e.g., statue of a person).
6. Photo shot from the back of a person.
7. Image is taken too far away from the person.
